My coursework for MIT OCW 6.006 Introduction To Algorithms Fall 2011 class. This covers the exact same coursework required of MIT students present at class for full marks.

All solutions are my own.

The Problem Set statements and their analytical solutions are available in the "Problem Set N Writeup.pdf" files. The corresponding code is in the accompanying source files.

For clarity, only created or edited code files are included.

Taught by [Prof. Erik Demaine](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=Prof.+Erik+Demaine), [Prof. Srini Devadas](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=Prof.+Srini+Devadas) and Recitation Instructor Victor Costan.

\*Quiz 1 scores were low across the board in the original Fall 2011 MIT class this course was recorded from. The course staff acknowledged this [here](https://youtu.be/a_otxyu0mSQ?si=FOkm1kT4oVYHMaTe&t=34): *"The results are lower than what we thought... the mistake was on our part."*
